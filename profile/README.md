# **Nexus City**

The Nexus is a city in the open verse, built with software, determination, and love. The Nexus serves as a virtual downtown, a global commons, a connection point leveraging technology to bring us closer to the world we want, and the web we want. The Nexus is about interconnection.

**Connecting the Dots**

We are passionate about the software we build to enable a more connected world, but we ourselves still feel disconnected. We created  **The Nexus** is the connection point, the link between worlds. We imagine a place for writers, poets, actors, artists, data scientists, software engineers, philosophers, psychologists– people from all walks of life– to gather together and build something beautiful and worthy of collective effort. We have experience building collaborative networks, maintaining open source projects. We know that getting a lot of people to coordinate on a large-scale, idealistic project is difficult but invaluable work. It is deeply important to us that our efforts be a positive force, pushing humanity to solve the problems of our age. We believe we can build something unique, community-owned, and open to all.

## **Technology**

### **Multiverse Architecture**

We imagine The Nexus as trans-dimensional, operating on many platforms and on adjacent hosted layers. Interoperability between different worlds is critical for the success of an open metaverse. We need specifications for avatars, wearables and equipment that are adopted across different platforms so that users can seamlessly bring their stuff anywhere and creators can maximize the value and reach of the assets they create.

### **The World Engine**

We built our own browser-based 3D world engine to power projects like The Nexus. The engine runs on every platform, in the browser and native, including VR and mobile. publicly available game engine to include full MMO multiplayer deployment at scale, built on React, three.js and many other open source frameworks and libraries.

### **AI Agents**

We built a software stack to create interesting, story-driven agents to populate the city. Each one has a unique personality and is capable of open-ended conversation. The AI agents can build relationships with each other, form meta-narratives and keep the world rich and interesting for all. Even when it’s quiet and nobody’s around, there’s something to do and someone to talk to in The Nexus.
